How It Works

2. Adding a Stock:â€¨When prompted, you can add a stock to your portfolio by providing:
    * Ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
    * Number of shares.

3. Viewing and Updating Portfolio:

4. Removing a Stock:â€¨You can remove any stock from the portfolio by providing its ticker symbol.
Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how the portfolio tracker works:
# Adding stocks
tracker.add_stock("AAPL", 10, 150)  # Adds 10 shares of AAPL bought at $150
tracker.add_stock("TSLA", 5, 700)   # Adds 5 shares of TSLA bought at $700

# Viewing the portfolio
tracker.view_portfolio()

# Updating the portfolio with real-time stock prices
tracker.update_portfolio()

# Removing a stock
tracker.remove_stock("AAPL")

Future Enhancements

Some ideas for future development:
* Multiple Portfolios: Support for tracking multiple portfolios.
* Historical Data: Track and visualize the historical performance of the portfolio over time.
* Export Reports: Add functionality to export portfolio performance to CSV or Excel.
* API Integration: Integrate with more financial data providers like Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud for better accuracy.
* User Authentication: Allow users to save and load their portfolio for future sessions.
